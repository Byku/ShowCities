ShowCities

It's a simple project with MVVM-C architecture using Combine instead of RxSwift. 

It just get a list of countries from https://restcountries.eu and shows these list as a tableview. If you tap the name of the country, you will know the name of the capital city =)

You can use pull-to-refresh gesture or read error information in case of network error.

There are a lot of features to improve this project technically or visually, but it works.
